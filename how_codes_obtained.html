  <h1>How the Codes Were Obtained</h1>

  <h2>1. Based on Objectives</h2>
  <p>The codes were written and adapted to align directly with the research objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>i.</b> Build a transfer learning model for image classification.</li>
    <li><b>ii.</b> Evaluate it with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
    <li><b>iii.</b> Compare it with a conventional machine learning baseline (SVM with HOG).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore, each section of code was chosen to implement exactly these objectives.</p>

  <h2>2. Using Standard Frameworks</h2>
  <p>The snippets come from widely used, open-source libraries to ensure reproducibility and accessibility:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>TensorFlow/Keras</b> → for <i>MobileNetV2 feature extraction & training</i>.</li>
    <li><b>PyTorch</b> → for <i>fine-tuning MobileNetV2 with flexibility</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Scikit-learn</b> → for <i>building the SVM baseline and evaluation metrics</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Skimage (hog)</b> → for <i>extracting handcrafted HOG features</i>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This structured selection of frameworks ensures that the code is grounded in standard, peer-reviewed practices in machine learning and computer vision.</p>
